             <h2>How to interpret your Globus identity data</h2>

             <p><a href="{{returnurl}}">Return to your data.</a></p>

             <p>The <b>{{pagetitle}}</b> application uses an OIDC service called Globus Auth. The
                Globus Auth API offers a standard OIDC interface described in the OIDC section
                of the main {{pagetitle}} page.</p>

             <p>In addition to the standard OIDC interface, Globus provides two other ways for applications 
                that use its Auth API to access information about their users. As with OIDC, the
                application's user must give his/her explicit permission, or consent, for the
                application to access this information.</p>

             <p>The Auth API's <b>get_identities()</b> interface returns much of the same information as the
                OIDC id_token. The "identities:" section, specifically, is mostly the same as the
                id_token. The main difference is when the application explicitly requests the optional
                "identity_providers:" section. This section provides a bit more information about the
                provider of the identity information.</p>

             <p>The Auth API's <b>oauth2_token_introspect()</b> interface is a standard OAuth 2.0 interface.
                It uses the access token for the Auth API that the application receives when the user 
                logs in to find out a bit more about the user and any permissions the user agreed to
                give to the application.  Specifically, the "scope" field shows which specific
                interfaces the user is allowing the application to use on his/her behalf, and the
                "aud" field displays the API the token can be used with: auth.globus.org, the Auth API.
                The "iat" and "exp" fields are in <a href="https://www.epochconverter.com/">Unix time</a>,
                and they note, respectively, when the access token was created for the application's use 
                and when it will expire, or no longer be valid.</p>

             <p>This application also requests identity_set information, so, assuming the user allows
                access when he/she logs in, the response from oauth2_token_introspect() also includes
                the identities_set, but only the "sub" fields are provided. Compare to the OIDC
                oauth2_userinfo() response above, and you'll see the same identities listed.</p>

             <h2>Changing or correcting your data</h2>

             <p class="data">When you visited <b>{{pagetitle}}</b> just now, your primary identity 
                provider was <b class="data">{{primaryidp}}</b>.</p>

             <p>The data returned by get_identities() mostly comes from your primary identity 
                provider. The application may request a specific primary identity provider, but if 
                it does not, the primary identity provider is set by Globus Auth and it will be different for
                each individual user. To change or correct the data returned by get_identities(), go to
                your primary identity provider's website and use its user profile feature to make
                changes. The next time you authenticate using that identity provider in a Globus 
                Auth client application, the get_identities() will return the updated information.</p>

             <p class="note">For XSEDE applications, the identity_provider should always be XSEDE, 
                with the domain "xsede.org". The get_identities() function will return information 
                from your XSEDE user profile.  (View your profile in the XSEDE user portal to compare 
                them.</p>
