        <p>Most OpenID Connect apps use the <b>ID Token</b> to identify individuals. 
           When you logged in, {{pagetitle}} received the following ID Token from Globus.  
           Explanations follow the data below. To learn how to correct this data, 
           <a href="{{explanationurl}}">click here</a>.</p>

        <pre>{{id_token}}</pre>

        <p>The ID Token typically includes the individual's name, an email address, a username, and a 
           <i>sub</i> (unique ID, short for "subject"). The sub is unique to the authentication 
           service (Globus) and will never be used for two different individuals.</p>

        <p>Globus ID Tokens include an <i>identity_provider</i> and <i>identity_provider_display_name</i>.
           These tell us which of your linked identities was used for this ID Token.</p>

        <p>You may have several linked identities in Globus, but the ID Token can only have one.
           Globus normally fills your ID Token with data from your primary identity in Globus.
           However, if an app requires an identity from a specific organization, Globus will use 
           that identity instead.  Either way, Globus will always give the app the same identity 
           for you, regardless of which organization you choose when you login.</p>  

        <p>The <i>organization</i>, <i>email</i>, and <i>name</i> are usually provided by the 
           individual when he or she registers with the identity provider.</p>

        <p>The <i>preferred_username</i> is contructed by
           Globus; it is the username reported by the identity provider and the identity provider's 
           primary domain. (Some services reuse usernames and/or allow individuals to change their usernames,
           so it is not guaranteed to remain the same for a given individual or never be reused. The
           <i>sub</i> field has those guarantees.) Although preferred_username looks like an email 
           address, it may or may not be a valid email address. Apps should use the <i>email</i> 
           field instead.</p>

        <p class="note">Some identity providers&mdash;especially academic institutions and schools&mdash;report
           anonymized usernames to prevent misuse of your username. In the 
           preferred_username field, you might see a random string of numbers and letters 
           instead of your actual username. The same string will be used consistently every time 
           you login.</p>
