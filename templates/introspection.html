        <p>OAuth 2.0 apps can use <b>token introspection</b> to get more information about an 
           access token. Explanations follow the data below. Introspecting your Globus Auth API 
           access token returns the following information. If you are concerned about 
           this data, <a href="{{globusexplanationurl}}">click here</a>.</p></p>

           <pre>{{globusintrores}}</pre>

        <p>The <i>name</i>, <i>sub</i>, and <i>email</i> are the same as in your 
           <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">ID Token</a>. The <i>username</i> is constructed by
           Globus; it is the username reported by the identity provider and the identity provider's 
           primary domain. (Some services reuse usernames and/or allow users to change their usernames, 
           so it is not guaranteed to remain the same for a given individual or never be reused. The 
           sub field has those guarantees.) Although preferred_username looks like an email address, 
           it may or may not be a valid email address. Apps should use the email field instead.</p>

        <p>Applications using the Globus Auth API may also request individuals' linked identities. This 
           information is available via token introspection and it appears as an identity set.
           (The values in the <i>identities_set</i> are the <i>sub</i> value of each linked identity.)
           When you logged in, {{pagetitle}} requested access to your linked identities.</p>

        <p>Applications using the Globus Auth API may also request details about how and when
           an individual authenticated with an identity provider. This information is available 
           via token introspection and it appears as <i>session_info</i>. The 
           <a href="{{ url_for('sessioninfo') }}">Session</a> panel in {{pagetitle}} explains this data.</p>

        <p>The <i>iss</i> (issuer) identifies Globus as the source of the access token. <i>iat</i>,
           <i>nbf</i>, and <i>exp</i> are times (in <a href="https://www.epochconverter.com/">Unix Epoch</a>
           format) when the token was created, when it becomes valid, and when it will expire.
           The <i>aud</i> (audience) identifies the service the token should be used with (Globus Auth API) and
           the app it was created for ({{pagetitle}}). The <i>client_id</i> also identifies the
           app that requested the token. The <i>scope</i> lists the actions the app may perform using 
           this token: viewing your profile, your OpenID Connect data, your email address, and your 
           linked identities.</p>
