             <h2>Changing or correcting your identity data</h2>

             <p>{{pagetitle}} obtains identity data from Globus. Globus obtains identity data
                from the organizations you've logged in with or have linked in Globus. These
                organizations are called <i>identity providers</i>.</p>

             <p class="data">When you visited {{pagetitle}}, your effective identity 
                provider was <b class="data">{{primaryidp}}</b>. Globus will always use the same effective
                identity provider for this app, but other apps may request a different effective identity
                provider.</p>

             <p>The data shown in your <b>ID Token</b>, from <b>token introspection</b>, and from the 
                <b>Identities API</b> mostly
                comes from this identity provider. To change or correct the data returned by these 
                interfaces, go to the effective identity provider's website and use its user profile 
                feature to make changes. The next time you authenticate using that identity provider in 
                any app that uses Globus, the data in your ID Token and shown by the Identities API and 
                token introspection will be updated with the new information.</p>

             <p class="note">XSEDE apps request XSEDE as the effective identity provider. When using
                these apps, your name, email address, username, and organization come from your XSEDE 
                user profile. (View your profile in the XSEDE user portal to compare them.)</p>
